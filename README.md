This project explores the use of AI and Machine Learning to predict a speakerâ€™s gender and age group based on their voice recordings.
Human voices naturally contain acoustic and prosodic features such as pitch, formants, and spectral patterns that vary across genders and age ranges. 
By extracting these features and training deep learning models, the system can classify both gender and age categories with high accuracy.
